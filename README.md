## About The Project

![Screen Shot](Resources/Screenshot.jpg)

Using EmguCV, this face recognition project for authentication can simultaneously identify both registered and unregistered users, providing relatively decent security using PBKDF2 hashing and AES cryptography which help store user data securely in a SQL server database.

Main Capabilities:

* Detecting humans face and recognizing registered and unregistered users with pretty high precision and speed. 
* Storing sensitive data including face image and passcode in byte[] arrays, fully encrypted and hashed respectively. 
* Using a local SQL server database 
* Using a customizable notification panel 
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm friendly


## Built With

Face detection and recognition libraries

* [EmguCV](https://www.emgu.com)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)

### Prerequisites

.NET Framework 4.8

### Installation


1. Download required binary files (release v1.0)
```sh
https://github.com/idpNET/secure-facial-recognition-security-system-using-emguCV.git
```
2. Clone the repo in visual studio
```sh
https://github.com/idpNET/secure-facial-recognition-security-system-using-emguCV.git
```
3. Right click on the project's title in the solution explorer and add the downloaded "x86" folder to the project folders.
4. For each dll file in the added x86 folder, set property "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy if newer".
5. Rebuild the project for x86 debug platform
6. Get started!

## Usage

You need to plug your webcam first! Then try connecting to the webcam,  facing towards the camera to get your face detected. You can now register yourself with a name and a passcode. After a successful registration, you'll get labeled as a registered user.
Notice! The more images of your face registered with various gestures, the more you are likely to get recognized as a registered user! 
Try to train the program with various head positions in quite various directions, hitting the register button whenever your get labeled as unregistered user. This helps the face recognition algorithm to know more about your face (You need to register your face gestures with the same name) 

 In order to check the login, face towards the camera and enter your passcode. If authenticated successfully, you'll be directed to the welcoming page.

P.S This project is well commented ! You can refer to the inline code comments for more information
